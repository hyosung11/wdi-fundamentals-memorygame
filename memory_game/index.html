	<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

			<h3>The Memory Card Game is both challenging and fun. It's challenging because it makes you think and retain information instead of googling the anwers on your smart phone (which you can't even do). It's fun because when you match cards you get a dopamine rush of pleasure at completing the task successfully. Play with the whole family. You can play as individuals or as team. Make it a compassionate competition and have prizes for both the winning and losing teams!</h3>
